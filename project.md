## TODO

* Find out how to declare defaults in Class objects

* Make two command lists don't collide


*IMPORTANT! commands should be separated in such a way so that they can be 
formatted and colorized separately. After all manipulations are done, 
they can be passed into execute module

## name convention

write name convention in one document, for now just comment in files

all case insensitive 
– [dsc] `description` 

– [auth] `author`
